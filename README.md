# design-critique-template
Creating a template and guidelines for effective design feedback and critique process.

## Design Feedback format

## Goal of this exercise

What type of feedback are you looking for? 

## Deadline

What is the time-frame in which you need the feedback?
i.e. something that blocks your work must have a deadline preferably in the next 48 hours but not sooner than 24 hours on work days. If you need something more urgent, either grab someone on Slack and discuss. OR trust your judgement and deliver your solution. 

## Set up context

State the problem.
Share screens, and steps to explain the flow to the particular design problem. 
State the expected results and any variations.

## State your Solution

With this much context, you can explain your particular solution for this problem.

- if you have explored more than one variations, provide all with obvious pros and cons you have thought of. This will save the back-and-forth on simpler things. Yet, the solution is documented for future reference.
- add any support documentation or research or data or findings - either from our own knowledge-bank (i.e. Hotjar interviews) or from outside ([Baymardâ€™s research on Address Line 2 in shipping address](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/shipping-address) -  I used this recently for Backpack 2.0) 


## Particular feedback -
- what is the exact point where you are seeking feedback?
    - it could be a design pattern, a new addition to components in the design system, or something like color scheme - every question is valid as long as you have a rationale behind your own solution.
- where else does a similar design pattern exist? 
    - for existing patterns in the platform, how does THIS particular pattern differ and what will it solve? What are measurable / non-measurable improvements?
        - measurable - reduced number of clicks, better legibility and contrast, something that takes 130 points of dev effort for marginal improvement
        - non-measurable - perceived speed of operation
- ask what DOES NOT work in terms of flow or visually
